 * Whether the glossary layer is on, and the term currently open.
 *
 * DEFAULT: ON.
 *
 * That is a deliberate product decision and worth writing down,
 * because the instinct is to default it off and let people opt in.
 * The reader this exists for — someone who does not know what a
 * "commitment" or a "solver-service" is — is exactly the reader who
 * will not go looking for a toggle labelled "explain the jargon",
 * because they don't yet know they need one. They just leave.
 * Meanwhile the cost to the expert is a handful of dotted underlines
 * they never click, and a switch that turns them off in one tap and is
 * remembered forever after.
 *
 * Asymmetric costs, so: on by default, off in one click, sticky.
