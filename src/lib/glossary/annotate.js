/*
 * src/lib/glossary/annotate.js
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Finds glossary terms in already-rendered prose and wraps the first
 * few occurrences in a <button class="gloss">.
 *
 * WHY POST-RENDER DOM WALKING, AND NOT MARKUP
 * -------------------------------------------
 * The obvious implementation is to write `<Gloss term="node">node</Gloss>`
 * into the copy. That was rejected for one reason: this site keeps
 * every user-facing string in seventeen dictionaries, and components
 * index into them positionally. Putting markup in the copy would mean
 * seventeen translators hand-placing seventeen sets of tags, forever,
 * and `check-i18n-keys.mjs` could not tell a missing tag from a
 * stylistic choice. The words would rot out of sync with the terms.
 *
 * Walking the DOM instead means: translators write plain sentences,
 * they list the words that should be explained in their language, and
 * the pairing is done by the machine every time the page renders. A
 * new term is one dictionary entry, not a hunt through the prose.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROMISES
 * ----------------
 * • Never crosses an element boundary. It only ever splits a single
 *   text node, so `<strong>peer-to-peer</strong>` inside a sentence is
 *   matched on its own text node, and nothing nests or unbalances.
 * • Never touches links, buttons, code, headings — see SKIP_TAGS.
 * • Idempotent. Marked spans carry `data-gloss`, and the walker skips
 *   any subtree that already has one, so re-running after a locale
 *   change or a scroll-triggered reveal cannot double-wrap.
 * • Fully reversible. `clearGlossary(root)` unwraps every span and
 *   normalises the text nodes back, which is what the off switch does
 *   — no reload, no re-render.
 * • Non-destructive to the framework. The ORIGINAL `Text` node is never
 *   thrown away: it stays in the document holding the first slice of
 *   its own sentence, and the marks and remaining slices are inserted
 *   after it. Svelte keeps direct references to the text nodes it
 *   created so it can later call `set_data()` on them; replacing one
 *   with a fresh node (which is what this file used to do) left that
 *   reference pointing at a detached node, and the next update wrote
 *   into nothing. See `clearGlossary` for the exact reversal.
 * • Layout-safe inside flex and grid. A text node split in place turns
 *   its siblings into flex/grid ITEMS, and whitespace-only anonymous
 *   boxes between items are discarded — so one sentence became several
 *   side-by-side columns with the spaces eaten. Every run is therefore
 *   wrapped in one inline span, so the parent still sees exactly one
 *   child box. Unconditionally, not only when the parent happens to be
 *   flex today, so a later stylesheet change cannot reintroduce the
 *   bug silently.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY
 * -------------
 * Each mark is a real <button> with aria-expanded and a description
 * ("Explain: peer-to-peer"), so it is reachable and announced. It is
 * not an <abbr title>: title tooltips are unreachable by keyboard,
 * invisible on touch, and cannot be styled or translated reliably.

			 * THE SHAPE OF A SPLIT, AND WHY IT IS THIS SHAPE
			 * ----------------------------------------------
			 * A split leaves exactly two nodes where there was one:
			 *
			 *   [ original Text (leading slice) ][ <span data-gloss-run> ]
			 *
			 * Everything generated — the marks and the text between them —
			 * goes inside that one span. Two separate framework problems
			 * force this, and one layout problem is solved by it for free.
			 *
			 * 1. Svelte keeps a direct reference to each Text node it
			 *    created and later calls `set_data()` on it. Replace that
			 *    node (which this file used to do) and the reference points
			 *    at detached DOM: the next update writes into nothing, and
			 *    the words on screen silently stop changing. So the original
			 *    node is never removed — only its `data` is shortened, and
			 *    `clearGlossary` writes the whole sentence back into it.
			 *
			 * 2. `{@html ...}` records the parsed fragment's first and last
			 *    child as the effect's `nodes_start`/`nodes_end`, and tears
			 *    the block down by walking siblings from start to end.
			 *    Anything outside that pair is never removed. Nodes appended
			 *    after the last one therefore SURVIVE a re-render and the
			 *    next render stacks new content on top of them — which is
			 *    how a language switch left a Spanish heading followed by an
			 *    English paragraph, and why the page grew a little more with
			 *    every switch. It cannot be dodged by picking a side: the
			 *    boundary nodes are not identifiable from out here (a
			 *    "last" text node still has comment anchors after it). It is
			 *    handled instead by (a) clearing synchronously before Svelte
			 *    re-renders — see GlossaryLayer — and (b) `sweepOrphans`
			 *    below, which recognises a run that has been separated from
			 *    its origin and deletes it. Keeping every generated node in
			 *    ONE element is what makes that recognition possible.
			 *
			 * 3. Free consequence: when the paragraph is a flex or grid
			 *    container, its children are flex ITEMS and the whitespace
			 *    boxes between them are discarded — a split sentence became
			 *    side-by-side columns with the spaces eaten. One span means
			 *    the container still sees a single child box.
